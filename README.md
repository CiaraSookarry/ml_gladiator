# ML Gladiator
Project where I try multiple models to classify the same dataset.

## Current Plan
- [x] Download iris dataset from here: [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
- [x] Split dataset into training, testing, and validation.
- [ ] Classify using logistic regression.
- [ ] Classify using a neural network.
- [ ] Classify using decision trees. 

## Dataset
* Contains 3 classes with 50 examples each
* Each class is a species of iris plant
    * One class is linearly separable from the other 2.
    * 

## Results and Comparisions
### **Logistic Regression**
### **Neural Network**
### **Decision Tree**
### **Decision Tree Ensemble**
